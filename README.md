# Ethical-Hacking-180-days-Journey
Gain solid ethical hacking skills in 6 months 
## Day 1  -  Enrolled to Udacity Ethical Hacking Course.
### Day 2 - Vulnerability Management.
Vulnerabilitys are openings weaken systems, and these weaknesses are called vulnerabilities. This lesson marks the start of our journey, where we will focus on vulnerability management. There are three key areas of focus:

Vulnerability Scanning
Prioritization and Response
Risk Scoring
We will finish this lesson with a small discussion on something I call The Game of False Results.

By the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

Configure custom policies and manage automated scans
Calculate risk scores and assign ratings
Use prioritization and response management tools to target response efforts
###To hack a system, you need three things:
- A vulnerability
- An exploit to trigger that vulnerability
- An interface between you and the affected target
There will be cases where you have a vulnerability but no exploit against it. There will even be cases where you have both but no way to interact with the target. If there is no attack surface, there is just no attack!

Whether it is ethical hacking, penetration testing, blue teaming, or anything else, our goal with information security is to reduce the attack surface as much as possible. This can only happen with a rock-solid vulnerability management program.
